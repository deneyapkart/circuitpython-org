We launched ODROID-M1 about 20 months ago and have supplied it to many B2B and B2C customers. Feedback from many customers requested a lower price, more GPIO ports, lower power consumption, a slimmer form factor, and a variety of practical peripherals.

We would like to introduce you to the ODROID-M1S which was developed over the past six months to respond to market demands. We made the board about 20% thinner, reduced power consumption by about 20%, added 14 header pins, and a built-in 64GB eMMC chip on the board. We have lowered the price to only $49 including a case, heatsink, and power adapter. We believe this will help significantly reduce the cost of building your own affordable and sustainable embedded systems. To ensure longevity, which is important to customers using it for industrial purposes, we will supply this product until at least 2036.

By utilizing 3D modeling from the early PCB design stage, we were able to complete case development relatively precisely and rapidly. It will be remembered for a long time as a novel development project in which collaboration between circuit design & mechanical design proceeded quite smoothly.
