LubanCat-4 is equipped with a quad-core A76+quad-core A55 eight-core CPU and a powerful Arm high-performance GPU, and has a built-in NPU with 6T computing power. Equipped with a Gigabit network port, mini-HDMI, USB3.0, MINI PCI-E interface, MIPI and other peripherals. While introducing high-usage interfaces, some low-usage interfaces and peripherals are deleted, significantly reducing the board area, and the reserved universal interfaces such as USB and MINI PCI-E are further expanded. In the usage scenarios of the board, the small body can still burst out great performance.

This allows LubanCat-4 to be used not only as a high-performance single-board computer, but also as an embedded motherboard for display, control, network transmission, file storage, edge computing and other scenarios.

The LubanCat-4 board provides a complete SDK driver development package, design schematics and other resources, which helps users further apply the board while greatly reducing the secondary development time based on this board and accelerating product launch.
