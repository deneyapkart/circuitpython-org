Luckfox Pico Mini is a cost-effective Linux micro development board, based on the Rockchip RV1103 chip to provide a simple and efficient development platform for developers; Supports a variety of interfaces including MIPI CSI, GPIO, UART, SPI, 12C, USB, etc., which is convenient for developing and debugging quickly.

- Single-core ARM Cortex-A7 32-bit core with integrated NEON and FPU
- Built-in Rockchip self-developed 4th generation NPU, features high computing precision and supports int4, int8, and int16 hybrid quantization. The computing power of int8 is 0.5 TOPS, and up to 1.0 TOPS with int4
- Built-in self-developed third-generation ISP3.2, supports 4-Megapixel, with multiple image enhancement and correction algorithms such as HDR, WDR, multi-level noise reduction, etc.
- Features powerful encoding performance, supports intelligent encoding mode and adaptive stream saving according to the scene, saves more than 50% bit rate of the conventional CBR mode so that the images from camera are high-definition with smaller size, double the storage space
- Built-in RISC-V MCU supports low power consumption and fast start-up, supports 250ms fast picture capture and loading AI model library at the same time to realize face recognition "in one second"
- Built-in 16-bit DRAM DDR2, which is capable of sustaining demanding memory bandwidths
- Integrated with built-in POR, audio codec and MAC PHY
