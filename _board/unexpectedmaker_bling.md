### There are 3 versions of BLING!

All versions of BLING come with a wonderful 40x8 RGB LED matrix made up of tiny 1x1mm addressable LEDs. They are all also the same size (99x22m) and come with 2.5mm half cut holes to allow for easy mounting using M2.5 screws.

What makes each version different is what components and features come on the back.

### Hello BLING!

The full version of BLING comes with an ESP32-S3 with 8MB of Flash, 2MB of PSRAM, and a bunch of onboard features and peripherals. Want to build a cool RGB Clock with custom alarm sounds? No problem! Want to build a portable Web Radio device? Yup, you can do that too! Want to play with captured audio? Maybe a nice audio level display? BLING has you covered!

Bling also comes with a user programable power switch to enable or disable the power to the LED matrix (more on that below), plus 4 user programmable buttons and a USB-C connector for power and for charging a battery, if you connect one.

### Hello TinyBLING!

TinyBLING doesn't have an included ESP32-S3 + peripherals on the back, but instead provides headers to plug in an Unexpected Maker Tiny board (TinyPICO, TinyS2, TinyS3 and the new TinyC6) to act as the brains for your project.

You also get a STEMMA/QT connector and a bunch of IO and power broken out on an extra header, for easy expansion. TinyBLING still has a user programable power switch to enable or disable the power to the LED matrix (more on that below), plus 4 user programmable buttons.

### Finally, hello SoloBLING!

SoloBLING is just the 40x8 RGB LED matrix on its own. It provides the BLING, you provide everything else.
