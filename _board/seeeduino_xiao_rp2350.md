The XIAO RP2350 packs the power of the Raspberry Pi RP2350 (switchable architecture of dual Arm Cortex-M33 cores running at 150MHz with FPU, and dual open-hardware Hazard3 RISC‑V cores, enhanced security and encryption) into the classic XIAO form factor. Measuring just 21x17.8102010550mm, it features 19 multifunction GPIOs, an RGB LED, and a Battery Management System with ultra-low power consumption of 27μA, battery power supply, and direct battery voltage measurement. Thanks to the XIAO ecosystem, the XIAO RP2350 is compatible with a wide range of add-ons, including displays, LED matrix, Grove modules, CAN Bus, Vision AI sensors, and mmWave sensors.
