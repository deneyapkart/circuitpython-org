**M5Paper** is M5Stacks latest core device with a touch enabled E-ink display. Powered by the ESP32-D0WDQ6-V3 this is our first device to integrate a super sized 540*960 @4.7" E-ink display,which supports 16 gray scale levels. The display is a GT911 capacitive touch screen,which supports two point touch and a variety of gesture controls . Compared to a regular LCD,E-ink displays are easier on the eyes, which makes them a great choice for reading or viewing for longer periods. Other benefits are the low power consumption and the ability to retain the image even if power to the display is terminated. Integrated in the CoreInk are an multi-function button for operation, SHT30 temperature and moisture sensor, physical buttons and an TF-card(microSD) port for data storage.

Additionally the FM24C02 internal eeprom chip provided 2K-bit(256x8)-EEPROM can be used to store vital data even when the device is off. A 1150mAh lithium polymer battery keeps the device going for long periods and battery life can be further preserved by using the RTC(BM8563)to set the device into deep sleep and wake it up again when neededã€‚Three HY2.0-4P expansion ports are included which allow for building complex projects using the existing sensors in the M5Stack ecosystem.
