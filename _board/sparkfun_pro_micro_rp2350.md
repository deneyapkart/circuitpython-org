The SparkFun RP2350 Pro Micro provides a powerful development platform in SparkFun's compact Pro Micro form factor, built around the RP2350 from the Raspberry Pi Foundation. This board uses the updated Pro Micro form factor. It includes a USB-C connector, Qwiic connector, WS2812B addressable RGB LED, Boot and Reset buttons, resettable PTC fuse, and PTH and castellated solder pads.

The RP2350 is a unique dual-core microcontroller with two ARM® Cortex® M33 processors and two Hazard3 RISC-V processors, all running at up to 150 MHz! Now, this doesn't mean the RP2350 is a quad-core microcontroller. Instead, users can select which two processors to run on boot instead. You can run two processors of the same type or one of each. The RP2350 also features 520kB SRAM in ten banks, a host of peripherals including two UARTs, two SPI and two I2C controllers, and a USB 1.1 controller for host and device support.

The Pro Micro also includes two expanded memory options: 16MB of external Flash and 8MB PSRAM connected to the RP2350's QSPI controller. The RP2350 Pro Micro works with C/C++ using the Pico SDK and MicroPython development environments.
