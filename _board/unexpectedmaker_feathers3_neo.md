**Onboard 7x7 RGB Matrix? Really?**

Yeah, why not! Getting compelling information out of a single RGB LED can be a real challenge, so with a 7x7 matrix, you can scroll text, show icons or even display cool animating patterns!

The RGB Matrix is powered from its own 3.3V LDO, which automatically shuts down if you put the FeatherS3 Neo into deep sleep. You can also turn off the RGB LED power via code by setting IO39 HIGH for on and LOW for off.
