FireBeetle 2 ESP32-S3 is a high-performance main-controller built around the ESP32-S3-WROOM-1-N16R8 module. ESP32-S3-WROOM-1-N16R8 comes with 16MB Flash and 8MB PSRAM for storing more data. The acceleration for neural network computing and signal processing workloads provided by the ESP32-S3 chip make the module an ideal choice for a wide variety of applications, such as speech recognition, image recognition, and so on.

FireBeetle 2 ESP32-S3 offers a camera interface onboard for easy connection with a camera. Also, an independent camera power supply circuit is designed, which helps reduce interference from other signals to the camera. The board comes with an OV2640 camera that offers 2 megapixel, 68° FOV, and up to 1600×1200 resolution. Besides, its onboard easy-to-connect GDI greatly saves the trouble of wiring for using with a screen. Meanwhile, the controller integrates a power management function, which enables users to charge a Li-ion battery and turn the hardware on/off.

In addition, FireBeetle 2 ESP32-S3 supports WiFi and Bluetooth 5 (LE) dual-mode communication that reduces the difficulty of networking, and also both Bluetooth Mesh protocol and Espressif WiFi Mesh are supported for more stable communication and a larger coverage area. With the support of Matter protocol, the board can be used to develop industrial standard smart home devices for a wider range of IoT scenarios.
FireBeetle 2 ESP32-S3 can be programmed by Arduino IDE, ESP-IDF, MicroPython and CircuitPython. Both C and Python are supported.

To use the camera under CircuitPython, you need to use the included frozen module `AXP313a`.
