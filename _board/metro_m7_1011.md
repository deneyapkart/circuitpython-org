Get ready for our fastest Metro ever - the NXP iMX RT1011 microcontroller powers this board with a 500 MHz ARM Cortex M7 processor. There's 8 MB of execute-in-place QSPI for firmware + disk storage and 128KB of SRAM in-chip, plus a WiFi co-processor using an on-board ESP32 module.

The iMX series of chips is the fastest microcontrollers around, with a Cortex M7 processor that is more powerful than the M0 or M4, and clock speeds of 500MHz+. For pure performance, there's nothing better! This chip family is well known for being featured in the Teensy 4 dev board series. Now we have a Metro-shaped board so you can use many Arduino shields, that is fully open source so you can adapt the design to create your own custom layouts, and a USB drag-n-drop bootloader plus CircuitPython support for easy development. Beginners and experts alike will enjoy the combination of low cost, roomy memory and storage, and no-soldering quick start.

Please note that this board does *not* have Arduino or Platform.io support. You can program it with CircuitPython, a fast-to-start embedded version of the popular Python programming language, or with [MCU Xpresso IDE for C/C++ advanced embedded development](https://www.nxp.com/design/software/development-software/mcuxpresso-software-and-tools-/mcuxpresso-integrated-development-environment-ide:MCUXpresso-IDE).

**Features:**

- **NXP iMX RT1011 processor** - ARM Cortex M7 processor running at 500 MHz, with 128KB SRAM and high speed USB!
- **AirLift WiFi Co-processor**, with TLS/SSL support, plenty of RAM for sockets, communication is over SPI and has CircuitPython library support ready to go for fast wireless integration.
- **8MB of QSPI XIP Flash**
- **ESP32 WiFi co-processor** - programmed with 'nina-fw' firmware as a SPI-to-Wireless
- **Power options** - 6-12VDC barrel jack **or** USB type C
- **UNO-shape** so shields can plug in
- **Reset** button - Click to restart, double-click to enter UF2 bootloder
- **Boot-mode switches** to get into the ROM bootloader (you can always reload code over USB if TinyUF2 gets corrupted somehow)
- **SWD connector** for advanced debugging access.
- **On/Off switch**
- **STEMMA QT** connector for I2C devices
- **On/User** LEDs + status **NeoPixel**
