Raspberry Breadstick is a long, lean, delicious development board with a unique form factor that simplifies your journey into the world of electronics. Whether your goal is to build a robot or an interactive art piece, you’ll begin by prototyping with a microcontroller development-board and a breadboard. Doing this with traditional dev-boards quickly leads to a tangled mess of jumper wires. The Raspberry Breadstick spreads its I/O pins out along the length of the breadboard, eliminating the need for long jumper wires, and delivers a clean prototyping experience that is easier to understand and troubleshoot.

The Raspberry Breadstick eliminates the need for lengthy jumper wires through a classroom-friendly design, while still catering to experienced hobbyists and engineers.

### Code with Ease in Python

The Raspberry Breadstick fully supports CircuitPython and MicroPython, offering a hassle-free coding experience. Embrace Python’s beginner-friendly syntax, a skill relevant across diverse industries. Why struggle with complex coding languages when you can save time and accelerate your projects with Python? Raspberry Breadstick’s also compatible with Arduino programming language for those that prefer that flavour.

### Explore Exciting Features

The Raspberry Breadstick is loaded with exciting components to help ensure your exploration is both educational and enjoyable. Control 24 vibrant RGB LEDs effortlessly using the [Adafruit DotStar library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_DotStar) or [FastLED library](https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED). Gather rotation & accelerometer data from the 6-axis IMU, opening the door to captivating LED POV displays that react to your every move as you wave your breadstick through the air!

### Maximize Pin Utility

Designed for your convenience, the Raspberry Breadstick’s strategic pin spacing ensures efficient use of every available pin, keeping your component layout clean and organized. Unlike traditional development boards that need long jumper wires to connect every component, our design maintains a clean and organized workspace.
