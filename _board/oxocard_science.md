This programmable multi-sensor board measures light/IR, temperature, noise, humidity, pressure and volatile compounds (VoC, eCO2 and ethanol). It comes with ready-to-use programs with documented source code, so you can start your own experiments right away.

The seven built-in environmental sensors provide twelve sensor values that you can experiment with. Use the built-in programs, modify them or write your own code.

We only perceive a small part of the environment with our senses. Impressive examples show you more about how to make the invisible visible. The card comes with over ten examples and small games - all with full source code and tutorials - that you can experiment with right away, even without programming.

Be amazed by impressive animations that show you how to simulate life. Bounce balls that move when you move the map.

On the board, which is only the size of a credit card, you'll find a high-resolution screen, five buttons, seven sensors and a powerful computer chip that you can program directly via a browser.

The Oxocard is programmed with the scripting language Oxoscript. This was optimized especially for small computers and is particularly suitable for beginners, since it contains many powerful commands from sensor technology, computer graphics and animation.

Thanks to ready-made programs, you can get started right away even without programming experience. We'll show you how to create amazing effects with simple adjustments.

With the pedagogical concept «Use-Modify-Create» starten wir mit fixfertigen Programmen, we start with ready-to-use programs that are adapted by means of instructions. This leads to faster results and increases the motivation to learn.
