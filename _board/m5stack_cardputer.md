Cardputer is a card-sized portable computer that is perfect for engineers. At the heart of Cardputer is the M5StampS3, a mini development board based on the ESP32-S3 chip. Cardputer features a powerful dual-core processor, supports Wi-Fi functionality and integrates various peripherals and sensors, making it ideal for rapid functional verification, industrial control and home automation systems.

The device is powered by an internal 120mAh+1400mAh (in the base) lithium battery solution, eliminating concerns about battery life. In addition, Cardputer has built-in battery charging and voltage regulation circuits that automatically adjust voltage and current to protect the battery and the device. The base of the Cardputer incorporates a magnet, allowing it to be attached to metal surfaces such as fridges or whiteboards. What’s more, Cardputer's structure is compatible with Lego hole extensions, allowing users to create even more interesting designs using Lego bricks.
