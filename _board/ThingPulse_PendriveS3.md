## Applications: BadUSB

Imagine having full control over any computer in seconds, simply by plugging in a device. That’s the power of tools that emulate a USB keyboard. Because computers inherently trust keyboards, these devices can take command with lightning speed.

Meet the Pendrive S3, a device that pretends to be a keyboard, bombarding the computer with hundreds of keystrokes per second—far faster than any human could type. By utilizing a straightforward scripting language, you can program the Pendrive S3 to execute any commands you want.

Now, take this concept to the next level with the Super WiFi Duck. This innovative tool lets you manage all your scripts wirelessly through a user-friendly web interface. No need for app installations, logging in, or tedious script transfers. With the Super WiFi Duck, everything is at your fingertips, making it easier than ever to unleash the full potential of a BadUSB device.
