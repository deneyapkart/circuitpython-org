There's an ATSAMD21 microcontroller on board with 4MB of flash, Neopixels, touch pads, and a little speaker.

The Coin M0 can run CircuitPython or Arduino very nicely and the flash storage is plenty for CircuitPython code, libraries, and data files (like sound effects).

- Native USB-C supported by every OS - can be used in **Arduino or CircuitPython** as USB serial console, MIDI, Keyboard/Mouse HID, even a little disk drive for storing Python scripts.
- Can be used with Arduino IDE or CircuitPython
