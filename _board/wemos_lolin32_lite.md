The WEMOS LOLIN32 Lite Board is the successor to the ESP8266. In addition to WiFi, the microcontroller also has Bluetooth and Bluetooth LE as well as more IO pins and improved analog inputs. The ESP32 can be programmed under Arduino. However, the board needs to be integrated first. I recommend the ESP32 only for advanced users, as it is not yet supported by all Arduino libraries. In addition to the WiFi/BLE SoC, the Lolin32 board includes a CH340G that converts USB to serial and allows your computer to communicate with the microcontroller. The LOLIN32 also has a LiPo charger with connection for 3.6V LiPo's, so you can realize your ESP32 project battery-powered and really wireless.

The ESP32 is great for small projects where you donâ€™t need so many I/Os, processing power or interfaces.
