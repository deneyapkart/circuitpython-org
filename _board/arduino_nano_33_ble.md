Please note that the pictured board is a Nano 33 BLE Sense. This build works with both the Nano 33 BLE and the Sense.

This compact and reliable NANO board is built around the u-blox NINA-B306 module, based on the Nordic nRF52840 and containing a powerful Cortex-M4F core. Its architecture, fully compatible with Arduino IDE Online and Offline, has a 9-axis Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and a reduced power consumption compared to other same size boards.
This allows the design of wearable devices and movement sensing projects that need to communicate to other devices at a close range. Arduino NANO 33 BLE is also ideal for automation projects thanks to the multiprotocol BT 5.0 radio.

The NANO 33 BLE Sense adds an APDS-9960 light, colour, gesture and proximity sensor; an LPS22HB pressure and temperature sensor; an HTS221 humidity sensor; and a MP34DT05 microphone.

To use this board with CircuitPython you must [replace the existing bootloader](https://forums.adafruit.com/viewtopic.php?f=60&t=158279) with the Adafruit UF2 bootloader. You need to restore the original bootloader to use the board again with Arduino.
