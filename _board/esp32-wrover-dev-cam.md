The Freenove ESP32-Wrover CAM board is an ESP32 development board with the ESP32-Wrover-E chip (with 4 MB PSRAM) and an OV2640 camera.

It has a USB-to-UART converter so it’s straightforward to upload code to the board. You just need to
connect a USB cable to the board and connect it to your computer to upload code or apply power. There’s no need for extra circuitry or an FTDI programmer (contrary to the ESP32-CAM AI-Thinker board).

It comes with several exposed GPIOs if you want to connect other peripherals like sensors and outputs (many more GPIOs than the ESP32-CAM AI-Thinker). Additionally, if you’re not using the camera, you can use it as a regular ESP32 with a wide number of available GPIOs. The GPIOs with a slash above the numbers are the ones used by the camera.

There are RESET and BOOT buttons, which makes it easy to reset the board or put it in flashing mode if needed.

### Features:

- ESP32-Wrover-E Chip with 4MB PSRAM
