The Elite-Pi is an RP2040-based controller with a Pro Micro/Elite-C compatible pinout that's primarily intended for use with keyboards.

### Features

- Compatible with Pro Micro-based PCBs
- Mid-Mount USB-C port for low profile
- RP2040 microcontroller
- Flash Memory: 16Mbit (W25Q16JVUXIQ)
- Up to 25 I/O pins available
- USB D+/D- accessible via pads
- On-board boot and run/reset buttons
- 1.6mm thick PCB
- Comes with two 12-pin headers and one 5-pin header
- Firmware Support: QMK, KMK, CircuitPython

In comparison to the Pro Micro or Elite-C, the Elite-Pi provides a few advantages over them:

- Flash memory: Lots of space to compile in various QMK features without worry, as the Elite-Pi has much more flash memory
- Price: Since the RP2040 microcontroller costs less than the ATmega32u4, we can provide it at a lower price than the Elite-C
- Flashing: Instead of using QMK Toolbox, you can just copy a complied .uf2 file to the Elite-Pi to update the firmware
