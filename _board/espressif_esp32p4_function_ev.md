ESP32-P4-Function-EV-Board is a multimedia development board based on the ESP32-P4 chip. ESP32-P4 chip features a dual-core 400 MHz RISC-V processor and supports up to 32 MB PSRAM. In addition, ESP32-P4 supports USB 2.0 specification, MIPI-CSI/DSI, H264 Encoder, and various other peripherals. With all of its outstanding features, the board is an ideal choice for developing low-cost, high-performance, low-power network-connected audio and video products.

The 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi 6 & Bluetooth 5 (LE) module ESP32-C6-MINI-1 serves as the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth module of the board. The board also includes a 7-inch capacitive touch screen with a resolution of 1024 x 600 and a 2MP camera with MIPI CSI, enriching the user interaction experience. The development board is suitable for prototyping a wide range of products, including visual doorbells, network cameras, smart home central control screens, LCD electronic price tags, two-wheel vehicle dashboards, etc.

Most of the I/O pins are broken out to the pin headers for easy interfacing. Developers can connect peripherals with jumper wires.
