A large Pico W powered E Ink® photo frame / home dashboard / life organiser with glorious seven colour display and wireless connectivity.

Inky Frame 5.7" features a big **seven colour E Ink display** (which can also be found on [Inky Impression 5.7"](https://shop.pimoroni.com/en-us/products/inky-impression-5-7)), with loads of space for displaying images, text, graphs or interfaces. There's **five buttons with LED indicators** for interacting with the display, **two Qw/ST connectors** for plugging in breakouts and a **micro SD card slot** for all-important storage of cat photos.

Every Inky Frame comes with a pair of sleek little **metal legs** so you can stand it up on your desk (and a selection of mounting holes if you'd prefer to do something else). There's also a **battery connector** so you can power it without annoying trailing wires, and some **neato power saving features** that mean you can run it from batteries for ages.

We've designed Inky Frame with organisation in mind, here are some things we reckon it would be really great for:

- Checking your calendar and upcoming appointments at a glance!
- Attaching to your office door to display your availability
- Displaying motivational posters, quotes, or images (fungible or otherwise)
- Showing cute graphs and readouts from local or wirelessly connected sensors.
