**ESP32-H2-DevKitM-1** is an entry-level development board based on Bluetooth® Low Energy and IEEE 802.15.4 combo modules ESP32-H2-MINI-1. Most of the I/O pins on the ESP32-H2-MINI-1 module are broken out to the pin headers on both sides of this board for easy interfacing.

Developers can either connect peripherals with jumper wires or mount ESP32-H2-DevKitM-1 on a breadboard.

ESP32-H2 is an ultra-low-power Internet of Things (IoT) solution offering multiple protocol support on a single chip. It integrates a 2.4 GHz transceiver compliant with Bluetooth ® Low Energy and IEEE 802.15.4-based technologies, supporting Bluetooth 5 (LE), Bluetooth mesh, Thread, Matter, and Zigbee. It has:

- A Bluetooth LE subsystem that supports features of Bluetooth 5 and Bluetooth mesh
- An IEEE 802.15.4 subsystem that supports Thread and Zigbee
- Radio protocols coexistence in 2.4GHz band
- State-of-the-art power and RF performance
- 32-bit RISC-V single-core processor with a four-stage pipeline that operates at up to 96 MHz
- 320 KB of SRAM, 128 KB of ROM, 4 KB LP memory, and 4 MB SiP flash inside
- Reliable security ensured by:
  - Cryptographic hardware accelerators that support AES-128/256, Hash, RSA, HMAC, ECC, digital signature, and secure boot
  - Random number generator
  - Permission control on accessing internal memory, external memory, and peripherals
  - External memory encryption and decryption
- Rich set of peripheral interfaces and GPIOs, ideal for various scenarios and complex applications.

**Features:**

- **ESP32-H2-MINI-1**: ESP32-H2-MINI-1, with ESP32-H2 inside which integrates a 2.4 GHz transceiver compliant with Bluetooth ® Low Energy and IEEE 802.15.4-based technologies, supporting Bluetooth 5 (LE), Bluetooth mesh, Thread, Matter, and Zigbee. This module is specially designed for all kinds of low-power IoT applications.
- **Pin Headers**: All available GPIO pins (except for the SPI bus for flash) are broken out to the pin headers on the board. For details, please see Espressif's [Header Block](https://espressif-docs.readthedocs-hosted.com/projects/esp-dev-kits/en/latest/esp32h2/esp32-h2-devkitm-1/user_guide.html#header-block).
- **3.3V Power On LED**: Turns on when the USB power is connected to the board.
- **5V to 3.3V LDO**: Power regulator that converts a 5 V supply into a 3.3 V output.
- **USB-to-UART Bridge**: Single USB-UART bridge chip provides transfer rates up to 3 Mbps.
- **ESP32-H2 USB Type-C Port**: The USB Type-C port on the ESP32-H2 chip is compliant with USB 2.0 full speed. It is capable of up to 12 Mbps transfer speed (Note that this port does not support the faster 480 Mbps high-speed transfer mode).
- **Boot Button**: Download button. Holding down Boot and then pressing Reset initiates Firmware Download mode for downloading firmware through the serial port.
- **Reset Button**: Press this button to restart the system.
- **USB Type-C to UART Port**: Power supply for the board as well as the communication interface between a computer and the ESP32-H2 chip via USB-to-UART bridge.
- **RGB LED**: Addressable RGB LED, driven by GPIO8.
- **J5**: Used for current measurement. See details in Section [Current Measurement](https://espressif-docs.readthedocs-hosted.com/projects/esp-dev-kits/en/latest/esp32c6/esp32-c6-devkitc-1/user_guide_v1.1.html#user-guide-c6-devkitc-1-v1-current).
