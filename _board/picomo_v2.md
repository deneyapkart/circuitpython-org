The [PicoMo](https://go.heia-fr.ch/picomo), based on a Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller chip, has been developed by [HEIA-FR](https://www.heia-fr.ch/en/)'s [Electrical Engineering](https://www.heia-fr.ch/en/education/bachelor/electrical-engineering/) and [Computer Science and Communication Systems](https://www.heia-fr.ch/en/education/bachelor/computer-science-and-communication-systems/) departments. With its display, temperature and humidity sensor, multicolor LED and buzzer, it can be used in a variety of ways.

This module has no battery to promote durability: you need to connect it to your smartphone or computer with a USB cable to make it work.

To flash a new .uf2 file and enter bootloader mode, turn on your PicoMo while pressing and holding the S7 button. This should make it appear as a drive named RPI-RP2 on your computer.
