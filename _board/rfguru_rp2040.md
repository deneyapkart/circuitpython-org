The **µPico Stick** is an affordable and high-performing development board, utilizing the **RP2040 PICO chip** developed by Raspberry Pi. You can also opt for a stylish case for added protection.

The **RP2040 microcontroller chip**, often referred to as "Raspberry Silicon," features a dual-core ARM Cortex-M0+ processor clocked at 133 MHz, 256 KB of RAM, 30 GPIO pins, and various interface options. Additionally, it boasts 2 MB of onboard QSPI flash memory for storing both code and data.

At [RF.Guru](https://rf.guru/), we employ this board for internal development and exploration of new product ideas. Given our focus on radio applications, we required a board with outputs that produce minimal noise.

**Enhancements Include:**

- Improved 3.3V LDO for reduced ripple (less noise).
- Incorporation of ESD protection and noise filtering on both the USB Data bus and the 5V DC input.

**On Board IO**

- 2 push buttons
- 2 RGB Leds
- A Piezo buzzer for audio output
- Pins It exposes RP2040 pins 16 till 24. 2 ADC ports, I2C bus, SPI bus and UART0
