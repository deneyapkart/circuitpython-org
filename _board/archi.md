Archi is an educational board powered by Raspberry Pi through its RP2040 microcontroller.
It is a portable and programmable device, which means that creators can take their learning anywhere. It is a combination of an electronic device and a complete educational platform, designed to be a learning tool, based on a block assembly structure method, dragging and dropping them in a visual editor.
Archi has the necessary features incorporated to have an instant return to your projects both visually and hearing, and you can also add various modules existing in the market that will allow you to expand complexity and develop your skills.
It is not simply a development board, it represents a window into the exciting universe of robotics and programming. Easy to use for all ages. Designed for the creation of robotic applications and STEM projects.
Archi is easy to transport thanks to its small case size, and is Arduino Shield compatible, to incorporate various modules for advanced projects. It is also easy to connect and program thorugh its USB-C input and does not require wiring or any professional input to use.
It is developed for educational purpose, so it can be programmed with blocks in the online platform, using Circuitpython or even C/C++ with the Arduino IDE.
