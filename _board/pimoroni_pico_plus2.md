A top of the line Pirate-brand RP2350 microcontroller with 16MB of flash memory, 8MB of PSRAM, USB-C, Qw/ST and debug connectors.

We adore the versatility and value of Raspberry Pi Pico but we also enjoy a souped up RP2350 board with all the extras baked in. With Pimoroni Pico boards, we've tried to cram in as much extra functionality as we possibly can whilst keeping to the original Pico footprint to maintain compatibility with existing Pico addons.

Pimoroni Pico Plus 2 is **powered and programmable via USB-C** and comes with an upgraded **8MB RAM**, **16MB of flash storage** and **easy to read pin labels**. It's super easy to connect up to things without soldering, with a **[Qwiic](https://shop.pimoroni.com/collections/qwiic)/[STEMMA QT](https://shop.pimoroni.com/collections/stemma-qt) connector** (for adding I2C sensors and breakouts), a **SP/CE connector** (for hooking up SPI/serial devices) and a **debug connector** (for if you like to program using a SWD debugger). We've also added a reset button, and a BOOT button - this can also be used as a user switch.

## Features

- 16MB of QSPI flash supporting XiP
- 8MB of PSRAM
- USB-C connector for power, programming, and data transfer
- Qw/ST (Qwiic/STEMMA QT) connector for attaching breakouts
- Intriguing SP/CE connector
- 3 pin debug connector (JST-SH)
- Reset and BOOT buttons (the BOOT button can also be used as a user button)
- User LED indicator
- On-board 3V3 regulator (max regulator current output 600mA)
- Input voltage range 3V - 5.5V
- Compatible with Raspberry Pi Pico add-ons
- Measurements: approx 53mm x 21mm x 9mm (L x W x H, including connectors)

## About RP2350

The RP2350 chip is the Double Quarter Pounder & Fries to the RP2040's Double Cheeseburger and can have one or more RISC-V burgers instead of either of the M33 ARMs, to stretch the metaphor.

In addition to the modern M33 ARM cores, there are sides of: more PIO capability, a variety of low power states for sipping electrons, a whole security system and some sprinklings of specialist digital video circuits to offload DVI/HDMI output.

You can expect a tasty boost in performance - our "real world" MicroPython tests are running up to 2x faster compared to RP2040, and floating point number crunching in C/C++ is up to 20x faster. The extra on-chip RAM will make a big difference when performing memory intensive operations (such as working with higher resolution displays) and even more can be added thanks to external PSRAM support.

RP2350 comes in two flavours - A (standard) and B (all the pins). The B chip has a stonking 48 usable GPIO pins, including 8 ADCs and 24 PWMs, and features on some of our new products.
