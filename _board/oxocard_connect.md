The Oxocard Connect is a small experimental computer in which you can plug in ready-made or self-soldered circuit boards. As you know it from game consoles, it then goes off immediately.

Choose from a variety of ready-made cartridges, plug them into the CONNECT and immediately a sample application will start showing you how to use the cartridge. No computer, no software installation and no wiring required.

Experiment with electronic circuits now - without the need for a computer. Enter the fascinating world of circuit design. Learn how LEDs, servos, light sensors and much more work.

Gone are the days when you had to buy a controller again for every electronics project. With the Oxocard CONNECT you can easily change projects by inserting the appropriate cartridge.

The circuit design of the cartridges is OPEN SOURCE and OPEN HARDWARE. Create your own cartridges for the Connect or use the cartridges with other microcontrollers.
