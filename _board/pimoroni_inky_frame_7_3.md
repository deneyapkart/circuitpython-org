There's a new ePaper screen in town, and it's a biggie! Inky Frame 7.3" features a **super crisp E Ink display** with 800 x 480 pixels of seven colour goodness. We've added **five buttons with LED indicators** for interacting with the display, **two Qw/ST connectors** for plugging in breakouts and a **micro SD card slot** for storing photos of fond maritime adventures (or whatever floats your boat).

Every Inky Frame comes with a pair of sleek little **metal legs** so you can stand it up on your desk (and a selection of mounting holes if you'd prefer to do something else). There's also a **battery connector** so you can power it without annoying trailing wires, and some **neato power saving features** that mean you can run it from batteries for ages.

Here are some things we reckon this mahoosive Inky would be great for:
- An ultra readable, low power consumption home automation dashboard
- Displaying stylised photos, pop art images or favourite comic panels.
- Showing cute graphs and readouts from local or wirelessly connected sensors
- Displaying fascinating data from online APIs.
