T-Display S3 pro is the upgraded version of T-Display S3.
The main thing is the use of a larger screen 2.33-inch screen and the addition of the chip SY6970 for phone OTG.
Continuing the way of T-display S3, the case is ABS, and there is added the expansion of the camera module through POGOpin for the use of a built-in module. Ambient light and proximity sensors on the top of the screen, two integrated QWIIC ports, and a battery power switch. An optional MPU9250 IMU module is also available internally.
