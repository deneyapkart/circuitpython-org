T-Deck is a pocket-sized gadget with a 2.8-inch, 320 x 240 pixel IPS LCD display, a mini keyboard, and an ESP32 dual-core processor. While it's not exactly a smartphone, you can use your programming knowledge to turn it into a standalone messaging device, or coding software.

CircuitPython now also supports the "Plus" variant.
